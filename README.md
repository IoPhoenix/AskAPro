The idea for this project came from the All-Women Hackathon in San Francisco.

This website will connect the employed professionals and the job seekers who can use some help and advice on their career, the industry or the corporate culture of a potential future workplace. The job seekers will be able to choose the pros based on language, experience or company name. 

This project was foremost created to faciliate the job search for female emigrants.
